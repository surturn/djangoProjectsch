        What is programming?<br>
Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems.You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.
Programming enables so many things in our lives. Here are some examples:
When you browse a website to find information, contact a service provider, or make a purchase, programming allows you to interact with the siteâ€™s on-page elements, such as sign-up or purchase buttons, contact forms, and drop-down menus.
The programming behind a mobile app can make it possible for you to order food, book a rideshare service, track your fitness, access media, and more with ease.
Programming helps businesses operate more efficiently through different software for file storage and automation and video conferencing tools to connect people globally, among other things.
Space exploration is made possible through programming.
